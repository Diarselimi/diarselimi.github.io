### This post will inform you about me mostly and my career
> No technical stuff here.

-- My name is Diar Selimi and I am a Kosovarian Software Developer, live and work in capital city Pristina.
Currently, I am working in an outsourcing company as a software developer but I work 90% of the time with PHP.

How I got here?
