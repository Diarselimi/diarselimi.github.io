### Diar Selimi
I'm a PHP Developer with extensive experience in building high-quality sites.

My experiences range from building responsive mobile sites that work well cross-browser to building scalable sites for the financial services industry. I like working on projects with a team that cares about creating beautiful and usable interfaces.

It's important to me to build long term relationships with clients, so I'm primarily looking for long term projects.

I'm flexible with my working hours and am happy to work closely with any existing freelancers you work with.

I look forward to hearing from you!
